# Description of files in repository
VIQRC Team 478A - Team NASA's Github Repository

* **MotorSpeedExperiment.iqblocks** - Blocks code to log odometry information for drivetrain motor velocities and headings from brain intertial. The data is logged to a file on the SD card that is inserted into the brain. The file names will automatically change and include a counter and the speed.

* **kp_experiment_odometry.iqblocks** - Blocks code (with Python sprinked using Switch blocks) for collecting odometry data during robot runs to find a good value for KP. Results and analysis are documented in our engineering notebook for the VEX IQ Rapid Relay season.

* **codev1_Manual.iqblocks** - Blocks code for driver skills and teamwork matches.

* **motor_speed_data** - Contains files which have the odometry data from running the **MotorSpeedExperiment.iqblocks** code at different motor speeds.

* **kp-experiments-data** - Contains files which have the  data from executing the **kp_experiment.iqblocks** code with different values for kp. The robot is moving forward for these tests.

* **Robot Data Analysis** - Google Sheets that has all the charts from sensor data. [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17E4Yq8iiLsh4XoXw-uVKB-Xu8Do3KBupUJwLyzSz9bg/edit?gid=0#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_2My34sckBAL1rHCEYeXWfyJ1qixPR3IRN6J8hixLds/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

* **auton.iqblocks** - Autonomous code
